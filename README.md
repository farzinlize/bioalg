execution:
- python prj.py [command] [options]

commands:
- BLK -> blocking: will generate a file containing blocks
    options:
        --category or -c: FLU for Influenza or MIT for mitochondrial
        --sequence-index or -s: file index in dataset
        --block-size or -b: block size
        --overlap or -o: overlap between blocks
        --filename or -f: result file name contains blocks
- CNT -> counting kmers: will use a generated file of blocks and report each kmer occurence and 8 bit scale
    options:
        --block-target or -t: address of a file that containts blocks (generated by BLK command)
        -k: kmer size
        --filename or -f: name for report file (kmers with their count and scale)
- CMP -> comparing two sequence: printing (output stream) the manhattan distance of two sequence
    options:
        --category or -c: FLU for Influenza or MIT for mitochondrial
        --sequence-index or -s: file index of first sequence for comparing in dataset
        --other-index or -n: file index of second sequence in dataset
        -k: kmer size

all options have default values (check source code)
